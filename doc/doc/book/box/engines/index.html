<p>A storage engine is a set of very-low-level routines which actually store and
retrieve tuple values. Tarantool offers a choice of two storage engines:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">memtx (the in-memory storage engine) is the default and was the first to
arrive.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">vinyl (the on-disk storage engine) is a working key-value engine and will
especially appeal to users who like to see data go directly to disk, so that
recovery time might be shorter and database size might be larger.</p>
<p>On the other hand, vinyl lacks some functions and options that are available
with memtx. Where that is the case, the relevant description in this manual
contains a note beginning with the words “Note re storage engine”.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Further in this section we discuss the details of storing data using
the vinyl storage engine.</p>
<p>To specify that the engine should be vinyl, add the clause <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">engine</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">'vinyl'</span></code>
when creating a space, for example:</p>
<div class="highlight-lua notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">space</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">box</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">schema</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">space</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;name&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="n">engine</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;vinyl&#39;</span><span class="p">})</span>

<span id="vinyl-diff"></span><h2>Differences between memtx and vinyl storage engines<a class="headerlink" href="#differences-between-memtx-and-vinyl-storage-engines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The primary difference between memtx and vinyl is that memtx is an “in-memory”
engine while vinyl is an “on-disk” engine. An in-memory storage engine is
generally faster (each query is usually run under 1 ms), and the memtx engine
is justifiably the default for Tarantool, but on-disk engine such as vinyl is
preferable when the database is larger than the available memory and adding more
memory is not a realistic option.</p>

<span id="engines-vinyl"></span><h2>Storing data with vinyl<a class="headerlink" href="#storing-data-with-vinyl" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Tarantool is a transactional and persistent DBMS that maintains 100% of its data
in RAM. The greatest advantages of in-memory databases are their speed and ease
of use: they demonstrate consistently high performance, but you never need to
tune them.</p>
<p>A few years ago we decided to extend the product by implementing a classical
storage engine similar to those used by regular DBMSes: it uses RAM for caching,
while the bulk of its data is stored on disk. We decided to make it possible to
set a storage engine independently for each table in the database, which is the
same way that MySQL approaches it, but we also wanted to support transactions
from the very beginning.</p>
<p>The first question we needed to answer was whether to create our own storage
engine or use an existing library. The open-source community offered a few
viable solutions. The RocksDB library was the fastest growing open-source
library and is currently one of the most prominent out there. There were also
several lesser-known libraries to consider, such as WiredTiger, ForestDB,
NestDB, and LMDB.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, after studying the source code of existing libraries and
considering the pros and cons, we opted for our own storage engine. One reason
is that the existing third-party libraries expected requests to come from
multiple operating system threads and thus contained complex synchronization
primitives for controlling parallel data access. If we had decided to embed one
of these in Tarantool, we would have made our users bear the overhead of a
multithreaded application without getting anything in return. The thing is,
Tarantool has an actor-based architecture. The way it processes transactions in
a dedicated thread allows it to do away with the unnecessary locks, interprocess
communication, and other overhead that accounts for up to 80% of processor time
in multithreaded DBMSes.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="../../../../../_images/actor_threads.png" src="../../../../../_images/actor_threads.png" />
</div>
<p><em>The Tarantool process consists of a fixed number of “actor” threads</em></p>
<p>If you design a database engine with cooperative multitasking in mind right from
the start, it not only significantly speeds up the development process, but also
allows the implementation of certain optimization tricks that would be too
complex for multithreaded engines. In short, using a third-party solution
wouldn’t have yielded the best result.</p>
<div class="section" id="algorithm">
<span id="engines-algorithm"></span><h3>Algorithm<a class="headerlink" href="#algorithm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Once the idea of using an existing library was off the table, we needed to pick
an architecture to build upon. There are two competing approaches to on-disk
data storage: the older one relies on B-trees and their variations; the newer
one advocates the use of log-structured merge-trees, or “LSM” trees. MySQL,
PostgreSQL, and Oracle use B-trees, while Cassandra, MongoDB, and CockroachDB
have adopted LSM trees.</p>
<p>B-trees are considered better suited for reads and LSM trees—for writes.
However, with SSDs becoming more widespread and the fact that SSDs have read
throughput that’s several times greater than write throughput, the advantages of
LSM trees in most scenarios was more obvious to us.</p>
<p>Before dissecting LSM trees in Tarantool, let’s take a look at how they work. To
do that, we’ll begin by analyzing a regular B-tree and the issues it faces. A
B-tree is a balanced tree made up of blocks, which contain sorted lists of key-
value pairs. (Topics such as filling and balancing a B-tree or splitting and
merging blocks are outside of the scope of this article and can easily be found
on Wikipedia). As a result, we get a container sorted by key, where the smallest
element is stored in the leftmost node and the largest one in the rightmost
node. Let’s have a look at how insertions and searches in a B-tree happen.</p>
<img alt="../../../../../_images/classical_b_tree.png" src="../../../../../_images/classical_b_tree.png" />
<p><em>Classical B-tree</em></p>
<p>If you need to find an element or check its membership, the search starts at the
root, as usual. If the key is found in the root block, the search stops;
otherwise, the search visits the rightmost block holding the largest element
that’s not larger than the key being searched (recall that elements at each
level are sorted). If the first level yields no results, the search proceeds to
the next level. Finally, the search ends up in one of the leaves and probably
locates the needed key. Blocks are stored and read into RAM one by one, meaning
the algorithm reads <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(logB(N)\)</span> blocks in a single search, where N is the number of
elements in the B-tree. In the simplest case, writes are done similarly: the
algorithm finds the block that holds the necessary element and updates (inserts)
its value.</p>
<p>To better understand the data structure, let’s consider a practical
example: say we have a B-tree with 100,000,000 nodes, a block size of 4096
bytes, and an element size of 100 bytes. Thus each block will hold up to 40
elements (all overhead considered), and the B-tree will consist of around
2,570,000 blocks and 5 levels: the first four will have a size of 256 Mb, while
the last one will grow up to 10 Gb. Obviously, any modern computer will be able
to store all of the levels except the last one in filesystem cache, so read
requests will require just a single I/O operation.</p>
<p>But if we change our
perspective —B-trees don’t look so good anymore. Suppose we need to update a
single element. Since working with B-trees involves reading and writing whole
blocks, we would have to read in one whole block, change our 100 bytes out of
4096, and then write the whole updated block to disk. In other words,we were
forced to write 40 times more data than we actually modified!</p>
<p>If you take into
account the fact that an SSD block has a size of 64 Kb+ and not every
modification changes a whole element, the extra disk workload can be greater
still.</p>
<p>Authors of specialized literature and blogs dedicated to on-disk data
storage have coined two terms for these phenomena: extra reads are referred to
as “read amplification” and writes as “write amplification”.</p>
<p>The amplification
factor (multiplication coefficient) is calculated as the ratio of the size of
actual read (or written) data to the size of data needed (or actually changed).
In our B-tree example, the amplification factor would be around 40 for both
reads and writes.</p>
<p>The huge number of extra I/O operations associated with
updating data is one of the main issues addressed by LSM trees. Let’s see how
they work.</p>
<p>The key difference between LSM trees and regular B-trees is that LSM
trees don’t just store data (keys and values), but also data operations:
insertions and deletions.</p>
<img alt="../../../../../_images/lsm.png" src="../../../../../_images/lsm.png" />
<p><a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">|br|</span></a></p>
<p>LSM tree:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>Stores statements, not values:</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last">
<li>REPLACE</li>
<li>DELETE</li>
<li>UPSERT</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Every statement is marked by LSN Append-only files, garbage is collected after
a checkpoint</li>
<li>Transactional log of all filesystem changes: vylog</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, an element corresponding to an insertion operation has, apart from
a key and a value, an extra byte with an operation code (“REPLACE” in the image
above). An element representing the deletion operation contains a key (since
storing a value is unnecessary) and the corresponding operation code—”DELETE”.
Also, each LSM tree element has a log sequence number (LSN), which is the value
of a monotonically increasing sequence that uniquely identifies each operation.
The whole tree is first ordered by key in ascending order, and then, within a
single key scope, by LSN in descending order.</p>

<p><em>A single level of an LSM tree</em></p>
<div class="section" id="filling-an-lsm-tree">
<span id="engines-algorithm-filling-lsm"></span><h4>Filling an LSM tree<a class="headerlink" href="#filling-an-lsm-tree" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Unlike a B-tree, which is stored completely on disk and can be partly cached in
RAM, when using an LSM tree, memory is explicitly separated from disk right from
the start. The issue of volatile memory and data persistence is beyond the scope
of the storage algorithm and can be solved in various ways—for example, by
logging changes.</p>
<p>The part of an LSM tree that’s stored in RAM is called L0 (level zero). The size
of RAM is limited, so L0 is allocated a fixed amount of memory. For example, in
Tarantool, the L0 size is controlled by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vinyl_memory</span></code> parameter. Initially,
when an LSM tree is empty, operations are written to L0. Recall that all
elements are ordered by key in ascending order, and then within a single key
scope, by LSN in descending order, so when a new value associated with a given
key gets inserted, it’s easy to locate the older value and delete it. L0 can be
structured as any container capable of storing a sorted sequence of elements.
For example, in Tarantool, L0 is implemented as a B+*-tree. Lookups and
insertions are standard operations for the data structure underlying L0, so I
won’t dwell on those.</p>
<p>Sooner or later the number of elements in an LSM tree exceeds the L0 size and
that’s when L0 gets written to a file on disk (called a “run”) and then cleared
for storing new elements. This operation is called a “dump”.</p>
<img alt="../../../../../_images/dumps.png" src="../../../../../_images/dumps.png" />
<p><a href="#id3"><span class="problematic" id="id4">|br|</span></a></p>
<p>Dumps on disk form a sequence ordered by LSN: LSN ranges in different runs don’t
overlap, and the leftmost runs (at the head of the sequence) hold newer
operations. Think of these runs as a pyramid, with the newest ones closer to the
top. As runs keep getting dumped, the pyramid grows higher. Note that newer runs
may contain deletions or replacements for existing keys. To remove older data,
it’s necessary to perform garbage collection (this process is sometimes called
“merge” or “compaction”) by combining several older runs into a new one. If two
versions of the same key are encountered during a compaction, only the newer one
is retained; however, if a key insertion is followed by a deletion, then both
operations can be discarded.</p>
<img alt="../../../../../_images/purge.png" src="../../../../../_images/purge.png" />
<p><a href="#id5"><span class="problematic" id="id6">|br|</span></a></p>
<p>The key choices determining an LSM tree’s efficiency are which runs to compact
and when to compact them. Suppose an LSM tree stores a monotonically increasing
sequence of keys (1, 2, 3, …,) with no deletions. In this case, compacting
runs would be useless: all of the elements are sorted, the tree doesn’t have any
garbage, and the location of any key can unequivocally be determined. On the
other hand, if an LSM tree contains many deletions, doing a compaction would
free up some disk space. However, even if there are no deletions, but key ranges
in different runs overlap a lot, compacting such runs could speed up lookups as
there would be fewer runs to scan. In this case, it might make sense to compact
runs after each dump. But keep in mind that a compaction causes all data stored
on disk to be overwritten, so with few reads it’s recommended to perform it less
often.</p>
<p>To ensure it’s optimally configurable for any of the scenarios above, an LSM
tree organizes all runs into a pyramid: the newer the data operations, the
higher up the pyramid they are located. During a compaction, the algorithm picks
two or more neighboring runs of approximately equal size, if possible.</p>
<img alt="../../../../../_images/compaction.png" src="../../../../../_images/compaction.png" />
<p><a href="#id7"><span class="problematic" id="id8">|br|</span></a></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Multi-level compaction can span any number of levels</li>
<li>A level can contain multiple runs</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the neighboring runs of approximately equal size constitute an LSM tree
level on disk. The ratio of run sizes at different levels determines the
pyramid’s proportions, which allows optimizing the tree for write-intensive or
read-intensive scenarios.</p>
<p>Suppose the L0 size is 100 Mb, the ratio of run sizes at each level (the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vinyl_run_size_ratio</span></code> parameter) is 5, and there can be no more than 2 runs per
level (the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vinyl_run_count_per_level</span></code> parameter). After the first 3 dumps, the
disk will contain 3 runs of 100 Mb each—which constitute L1 (level one). Since 3
&gt; 2, the runs will be compacted into a single 300 Mb run, with the older ones
being deleted. After 2 more dumps, there will be another compaction, this time
of 2 runs of 100 Mb each and the 300 Mb run, which will produce one 500 Mb run.
It will be moved to L2 (recall that the run size ratio is 5), leaving L1 empty.
The next 10 dumps will result in L2 having 3 runs of 500 Mb each, which will be
compacted into a single 1500 Mb run. Over the course of 10 more dumps, the
following will happen: 3 runs of 100 Mb each will be compacted twice, as will
two 100 Mb runs and one 300 Mb run, which will yield 2 new 500 Mb runs in L2.
Since L2 now has 3 runs, they will also be compacted: two 500 Mb runs and one
1500 Mb run will produce a 2500 Mb run that will be moved to L3, given its size.</p>
<p>This can go on infinitely, but if an LSM tree contains lots of deletions, the
resulting compacted run can be moved not only down, but also up the pyramid due
to its size being smaller than the sizes of the original runs that were
compacted. In other words, it’s enough to logically track which level a certain
run belongs to, based on the run size and the smallest and greatest LSN among
all of its operations.</p>

<div class="section" id="controlling-the-form-of-an-lsm-tree">
<span id="vinyl-algorithm-form-control"></span><h4>Controlling the form of an LSM tree<a class="headerlink" href="#controlling-the-form-of-an-lsm-tree" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>If it’s necessary to reduce the number of runs for lookups, then the run size
ratio can be increased, thus bringing the number of levels down. If, on the
other hand, you need to minimize the compaction-related overhead, then the run
size ratio can be decreased: the pyramid will grow higher, and even though runs
will be compacted more often, they will be smaller, which will reduce the total
amount of work done. In general, write amplification in an LSM tree is described
by this formula: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(log_{x}(\frac {N} {L0}) × x\)</span> or, alternatively,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x × \frac {ln (\frac {N} {C0})} {ln(x)}\)</span>, where N is
the total size of all tree elements, L0 is the level zero size, and x is the
level size ratio (the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">level_size_ratio</span></code> parameter). At <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac {N} {C0}\)</span> = 40 (the disk-to-
memory ratio), the plot would look something like this:</p>
<img alt="../../../../../_images/curve.png" src="../../../../../_images/curve.png" />
<p><a href="#id9"><span class="problematic" id="id10">|br|</span></a></p>
<p>As for read amplification, it’s proportional to the number of levels. The lookup
cost at each level is no greater than that for a B-tree. Getting back to the
example of a tree with 100,000,000 elements: given 256 Mb of RAM and the default
values of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vinyl_run_size_ratio</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vinyl_run_count_per_level</span></code>, write
amplification would come out to about 13, while read amplification could be as
high as 150. Let’s try to figure out why this happens.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="search">
<span id="vinyl-algorithm-search"></span><h4>Search<a class="headerlink" href="#search" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>When doing a lookup in an LSM tree, what we need to find is not the element
itself, but the most recent operation associated with it. If it’s a deletion,
then the tree doesn’t contain this element. If it’s an insertion, we need to
grab the topmost value in the pyramid, and the search can be stopped after
finding the first matching key. In the worst-case scenario, that is if the tree
doesn’t hold the needed element, the algorithm will have to sequentially visit
all of the levels, starting from L0.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this scenario is quite common in real life. For example, when
inserting a value into a tree, it’s necessary to make sure there are no
duplicates among primary/unique keys. So to speed up membership checks, LSM
trees use a probabilistic data structure called a “Bloom filter”, which will be
covered a bit later, in a section on how vinyl works under the hood.</p>

<p>In the case of a single-key search, the algorithm stops after encountering the
first match. However, when searching within a certain key range (for example,
looking for all the users with the last name “Ivanov”), it’s necessary to scan
all tree levels.</p>
<img alt="../../../../../_images/range_search.png" src="../../../../../_images/range_search.png" />
<p><em>Searching within a range of [24,30)</em></p>
<p>The required range is formed the same way as when compacting several runs: the
algorithm picks the key with the largest LSN out of all the sources, ignoring
the other associated operations, then moves on to the next key and repeats the
procedure.</p>
<div class="section" id="deletion">

<p>Why would one store deletions? And why doesn’t it lead to a tree overflow in the
case of for i=1,10000000 put(i) delete(i) end?</p>
<p>With regards to lookups, deletions signal the absence of a value being searched;
with compactions, they clear the tree of “garbage” records with older LSNs.</p>
<p>While the data is in RAM only, there’s no need to store deletions. Similarly,
you don’t need to keep them following a compaction if they affect, among other
things, the lowest tree level, which contains the oldest dump. Indeed, if a
value can’t be found at the lowest level, then it doesn’t exist in the tree.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We can’t delete from append-only files</li>

<p><em>Deletion, step 3: in the case of a major compaction, the tombstone is removed from the tree</em></p>
<p>If a deletion is known to come right after the insertion of a unique value,
which is often the case when modifying a value in a secondary index, then the
deletion can safely be filtered out while compacting intermediate tree levels.
This optimization is implemented in vinyl.</p>

<p>Apart from decreasing write amplification, the approach that involves
periodically dumping level L0 and compacting levels L1-Lk has a few advantages
over the approach to writes adopted by B-trees:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Dumps and compactions write relatively large files: typically, the L0 size
is 50-100 Mb, which is thousands of times larger than the size of a B-tree
block.</li>
<li>This large size allows efficiently compressing data before writing it.
Tarantool compresses data automatically, which further decreases write
amplification.</li>
<li>There is no fragmentation overhead, since there’s no
padding/empty space between the elements inside a run.</li>
<li>All operations create
new runs instead of modifying older data in place. This allows avoiding those
nasty locks that everyone hates so much. Several operations can run in
parallel without causing any conflicts. This also simplifies making backups
and moving data to replicas.</li>
<li>Storing older versions of data allows for the
efficient implementation of transaction support by using multiversion

<p>One of the key advantages of the B-tree as a search data structure is its
predictability: all operations take no longer than <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(log_{B}(N)\)</span> to run.
Conversely, in a classical LSM tree, both read and write speeds can differ by a
factor of hundreds (best case scenario) or even thousands (worst case scenario).
For example, adding just one element to L0 can cause it to overflow, which can
trigger a chain reaction in levels L1, L2, and so on. Lookups may find the
needed element in L0 or may need to scan all of the tree levels. It’s also
necessary to optimize reads within a single level to achieve speeds comparable
to those of a B-tree. Fortunately, most disadvantages can be mitigated or even
eliminated with additional algorithms and data structures. Let’s take a closer
look at these disadvantages and how they’re dealt with in Tarantool.</p>
<div class="section" id="unpredictable-write-speed">
<span id="vinyl-lsm-disadvantages-write-speed"></span><h4>Unpredictable write speed<a class="headerlink" href="#unpredictable-write-speed" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>In an LSM tree, insertions almost always affect L0 only. How do you avoid idle
time when the memory area allocated for L0 is full?</p>
<p>Clearing L0 involves two lengthy operations: writing to disk and memory
deallocation. To avoid idle time while L0 is being dumped, Tarantool uses
writeaheads. Suppose the L0 size is 256 Mb. The disk write speed is 10 Mbps.
Then it would take 26 seconds to dump L0. The insertion speed is 10,000 RPS,
with each key having a size of 100 bytes. While L0 is being dumped, it’s
necessary to reserve 26 Mb of RAM, effectively slicing the L0 size down to 230
Mb.</p>
<p>Tarantool does all of these calculations automatically, constantly updating the
rolling average of the DBMS workload and the histogram of the disk speed. This
allows using L0 as efficiently as possible and it prevents write requests from
timing out. But in the case of workload surges, some wait time is still
possible. That’s why we also introduced an insertion timeout (the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vinyl_timeout</span></code> parameter), which is set to 60 seconds by default. The write
operation itself is executed in dedicated threads. The number of these threads
(2 by default) is controlled by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vinyl_write_threads</span></code> parameter. The default
value of 2 allows doing dumps and compactions in parallel, which is also
necessary for ensuring system predictability.</p>
<p>In Tarantool, compactions are always performed independently of dumps, in a
separate execution thread. This is made possible by the append-only nature of an
LSM tree: after dumps runs are never changed, and compactions simply create new
runs.</p>
<p>Delays can also be caused by L0 rotation and the deallocation of memory dumped
to disk: during a dump, L0 memory is owned by two operating system threads, a
transaction processing thread and a write thread. Even though no elements are
being added to the rotated L0, it can still be used for lookups. To avoid read
locks when doing lookups, the write thread doesn’t deallocate the dumped memory,
instead delegating this task to the transaction processor thread. Following a
dump, memory deallocation itself happens instantaneously: to achieve this, L0
uses a special allocator that deallocates all of the memory with a single
operation.</p>

<p>Optimizing reads is the most difficult optimization task with regards to LSM
trees. The main complexity factor here is the number of levels: any optimization
causes not only much slower lookups, but also tends to require significantly
larger RAM resources. Fortunately, the append-only nature of LSM trees allows us
to address these problems in ways that would be nontrivial for traditional data
structures.</p>

<span id="vinyl-lsm-disadvantages-compression"></span><h4>Compression and page index<a class="headerlink" href="#compression-and-page-index" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>In B-trees, data compression is either the hardest problem to crack or a great
marketing tool—rather than something really useful. In LSM trees, compression
works as follows:</p>
<p>During a dump or compaction all of the data within a single run is split into
pages. The page size (in bytes) is controlled by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vinyl_page_size</span></code>
parameter and can be set separately for each index. A page doesn’t have to be
exactly of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vinyl_page_size</span></code> size—depending on the data it holds, it can be a
little bit smaller or larger. Because of this, pages never have any empty space
inside.</p>
<p>Data is compressed by
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/facebook/zstd">Facebook’s streaming algorithm</a>
called “zstd”. The first key of each page, along with the page offset, is added
to a “page index”, which is a separate file that allows the quick retrieval
of any page. After a dump or compaction, the page index of the created run is
also written to disk.</p>
<p>All <cite>.index</cite> files are cached in RAM, which allows finding the necessary page
with a single lookup in a <cite>.run</cite> file (in vinyl, this is the extension of files
resulting from a dump or compaction). Since data within a page is sorted, after
it’s read and decompressed, the needed key can be found using a regular binary
search. Decompression and reads are handled by separate threads, and are
controlled by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vinyl_read_threads</span></code> parameter.</p>
<p>Tarantool uses a universal file format: for example, the format of a <cite>.run</cite> file
is no different from that of an <cite>.xlog</cite> file (log file). This simplifies backup
and recovery as well as the usage of external tools.</p>
<div class="section" id="bloom-filters">
<span id="vinyl-lsm-disadvantages-compression-bloom-filters"></span><h5>Bloom filters<a class="headerlink" href="#bloom-filters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Even though using a page index enables scanning fewer pages per run when doing a
lookup, it’s still necessary to traverse all of the tree levels. There’s a
special case, which involves checking if particular data is absent when scanning
all of the tree levels and it’s unavoidable: I’m talking about insertions into a
unique index. If the data being inserted already exists, then inserting the same
data into a unique index should lead to an error. The only way to throw an error
in an LSM tree before a transaction is committed is to do a search before
inserting the data. Such reads form a class of their own in the DBMS world and
are called “hidden” or “parasitic” reads.</p>
<p>Another operation leading to hidden reads is updating a value in a field on
which a secondary index is defined. Secondary keys are regular LSM trees that
store differently ordered data. In most cases, in order not to have to store all
of the data in all of the indexes, a value associated with a given key is kept
in whole only in the primary index (any index that stores both a key and a value
is called “covering” or “clustered”), whereas the secondary index only stores
the fields on which a secondary index is defined, and the values of the fields
that are part of the primary index. Thus, each time a change is made to a value
in a field on which a secondary index is defined, it’s necessary to first remove
the old key from the secondary index—and only then can the new key be inserted.
At update time, the old value is unknown, and it is this value that needs to be
read in from the primary key “under the hood”.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>update t1 <span class="nb">set</span> <span class="nv">city</span><span class="o">=</span>’Moscow’ where <span class="nv">id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="m">1</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To minimize the number of disk reads, especially for nonexistent data, nearly
all LSM trees use probabilistic data structures, and Tarantool is no exception.
A classical Bloom filter is made up of several (usually 3-to-5) bit arrays. When
data is written, several hash functions are calculated for each key in order to
get corresponding array positions. The bits at these positions are then set to
1. Due to possible hash collisions, some bits might be set to 1 twice. We’re
most interested in the bits that remain 0 after all keys have been added. When
looking for an element within a run, the same hash functions are applied to
produce bit positions in the arrays. If any of the bits at these positions is 0,
then the element is definitely not in the run. The probability of a false
positive in a Bloom filter is calculated using Bayes’ theorem: each hash
function is an independent random variable, so the probability of a collision
simultaneously occurring in all of the bit arrays is infinitesimal.</p>
<p>The key advantage of Bloom filters in Tarantool is that they’re easily
configurable. The only parameter that can be specified separately for each index
is called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vinyl_bloom_fpr</span></code> (FPR stands for “false positive ratio”) and it has the
default value of 0.05, which translates to a 5% FPR. Based on this parameter,
Tarantool automatically creates Bloom filters of the optimal size for partial-
key and full-key searches. The Bloom filters are stored in the <cite>.index</cite> file,
along with the page index, and are cached in RAM.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="caching">
<span id="vinyl-lsm-disadvantages-compression-caching"></span><h5>Caching<a class="headerlink" href="#caching" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>A lot of people think that caching is a silver bullet that can help with any
performance issue. “When in doubt, add more cache”. In vinyl, caching is viewed
rather as a means of reducing the overall workload and consequently, of getting
a more stable response time for those requests that don’t hit the cache. vinyl
boasts a unique type of cache among transactional systems called a “range tuple
cache”. Unlike, say, RocksDB or MySQL, this cache doesn’t store pages, but
rather ranges of index values obtained  from disk, after having performed a
compaction spanning all tree levels. This allows the use of caching for both
single-key and key-range searches. Since this method of caching stores only hot
data and not, say, pages (you may need only some data from a page), RAM is used
in the most efficient way possible. The cache size is controlled by the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vinyl_cache</span></code> parameter.</p>

<p>Chances are that by now you’ve started losing focus and need a well-deserved
dopamine reward. Feel free to take a break, since working through the rest of
the article is going to take some serious mental effort.</p>
<p>An LSM tree in vinyl is just a small piece of the puzzle. Even with a single
table (or so-called “space”), vinyl creates and maintains several LSM trees, one
for each index. But even a single index can be comprised of dozens of LSM trees.
Let’s try to understand why this might be necessary.</p>
<p>Recall our example with a tree containing 100,000,000 records, 100 bytes each.
As time passes, the lowest LSM level may end up holding a 10 Gb run. During
compaction, a temporary run of approximately the same size will be created. Data
at intermediate levels takes up some space as well, since the tree may store
several operations associated with a single key. In total, storing 10 Gb of
actual data may require up to 30 Gb of free space: 10 Gb for the last tree
level, 10 Gb for a temporary run, and 10 Gb for the remaining data. But what if
the data size is not 10 Gb, but 1 Tb? Requiring that the available disk space
always be several times greater than the actual data size is financially
unpractical, not to mention that it may take dozens of hours to create a 1 Tb
run. And in the case of an emergency shutdown or system restart, the process
would have to be started from scratch.</p>
<p>Here’s another scenario. Suppose the primary key is a monotonically increasing
sequence—for example, a time series. In this case, most insertions will fall
into the right part of the key range, so it wouldn’t make much sense to do a
compaction just to append a few million more records to an already huge run.</p>
<p>But what if writes predominantly occur in a particular region of the key range,
whereas most reads take place in a different region? How do you optimize the
form of the LSM tree in this case? If it’s too high, read performance is
impacted; if it’s too low—write speed is reduced.</p>
<p>Tarantool “factorizes” this problem by creating multiple LSM trees for each
index. The approximate size of each subtree may be controlled by the
<a class="reference internal" href="../../../reference/configuration/index.html#cfg-storage-vinyl-range-size"><span class="std std-ref">vinyl_range_size</span></a> configuration parameter. We call such
subtrees “ranges”.</p>
<img alt="../../../../../_images/factor_lsm.png" src="../../../../../_images/factor_lsm.png" />
<p><a href="#id13"><span class="problematic" id="id14">|br|</span></a></p>
<p>Factorizing large LSM trees via ranging</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Ranges reflect a static layout of sorted runs</li>
<li>Slices connect a sorted run into a range</li>
</ul>
<p id="engines-vinyl-split">Initially, when the index has few elements, it consists of a single range. As more
elements are added, its total size may exceed
<a class="reference internal" href="../../../reference/configuration/index.html#cfg-storage-vinyl-range-size"><span class="std std-ref">the maximum range size</span></a>. In that case a
special operation called “split” divides the tree into two equal parts. The tree
is split at the middle element in the range of keys stored in the tree. For
example, if  the tree initially stores the full range of -inf…+inf, then after
splitting it at the middle key X, we get two subtrees: one that stores the range
of -inf…X, and the other storing the range of X…+inf. With this approach, we
always know which subtree to use for writes and which one for reads. If the tree
contained deletions and each of the neighboring ranges grew smaller as a result,
the opposite operation called “coalesce” combines two neighboring trees into
one.</p>
<p>Split and coalesce don’t entail a compaction, the creation of new runs, or other
resource-intensive operations. An LSM tree is just a collection of runs. vinyl
has a special metadata log that helps keep track of which run belongs to which
subtree(s). This has the <cite>.vylog</cite> extension and its format is compatible with an
.xlog file. Similarly to an <cite>.xlog</cite> file, the metadata log gets rotated at each
checkpoint. To avoid the creation of extra runs with split and coalesce, we have
also introduced an auxiliary entity called “slice”. It’s a reference to a run
containing a key range and it’s stored only in the metadata log. Once the
reference counter drops to zero, the corresponding file gets removed. When it’s
necessary to perform a split or to coalesce, Tarantool creates slice objects for
each new tree, removes older slices, and writes these operations to the metadata
log, which literally stores records that look like this: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;tree</span> <span class="pre">id,</span> <span class="pre">slice</span> <span class="pre">id&gt;</span></code>
or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;slice</span> <span class="pre">id,</span> <span class="pre">run</span> <span class="pre">id,</span> <span class="pre">min,</span> <span class="pre">max&gt;</span></code>.</p>
<p>This way all of the heavy lifting associated with splitting a tree into two
subtrees is postponed until a compaction and then is performed automatically. A
huge advantage of dividing all of the keys into ranges is the ability to
independently control the L0 size as well as the dump and compaction processes
for each subtree, which makes these processes manageable and predictable. Having
a separate metadata log also simplifies the implementation of both “truncate”
and “drop”. In vinyl, they’re processed instantly, since they only work with the
metadata log, while garbage collection is done in the background.</p>

<div class="section" id="upsert">
<span id="vinyl-advanced-features-upsert"></span><h4>Upsert<a class="headerlink" href="#upsert" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>In the previous sections, we mentioned only two operations stored by an
LSM tree: deletion and replacement. Let’s take a look at how all of the other
operations can be represented. An insertion can be represented via a
replacement—you just need to make sure there are no other elements with the
specified key. To perform an update, it’s necessary to read the older value from
the tree, so it’s easier to represent this operation as a replacement as
well—this speeds up future read requests by the key. Besides, an update must
return the new value, so there’s no avoiding hidden reads.</p>
<p>In B-trees, the cost
of hidden reads is negligible: to update a block, it first needs to be read from
disk anyway. Creating a special update operation for an LSM tree that doesn’t
cause any hidden reads is really tempting.</p>
<p>Such an operation must contain not
only a default value to be inserted if a key has no value yet, but also a list
of update operations to perform if a value does exist.</p>
<p>At transaction execution
time, Tarantool just saves the operation in an LSM tree, then “executes” it
later, during a compaction.</p>
<p>The upsert operation:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>space:upsert<span class="o">(</span>tuple, <span class="o">{{</span>operator, field, value<span class="o">}</span>, ... <span class="o">})</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Non-reading update or insert</li>
<li>Delayed execution</li>
<li>Background upsert squashing prevents upserts from piling up</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, postponing the operation execution until a
compaction doesn’t leave much leeway in terms of error handling. That’s why
Tarantool tries to validate upserts as fully as possible before writing them to
an LSM tree. However, some checks are only possible with older data on hand, for
example when the update operation is trying to add a number to a string or to
remove a field that doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>A semantically similar operation exists in
many products including PostgreSQL and MongoDB. But anywhere you look, it’s just
syntactic sugar that combines the update and replace operations without avoiding
hidden reads. Most probably, the reason is that LSM trees as data storage structures
are relatively new.</p>
<p>Even though an upsert is a very important optimization and
implementing it cost us a lot of blood, sweat, and tears, we must admit that it
has limited applicability. If a table contains secondary keys or triggers,
hidden reads can’t be avoided. But if you have a scenario where secondary keys
are not required and the update following the transaction completion will
certainly not cause any errors, then the operation is for you.</p>
<p>I’d like to tell
you a short story about an upsert. It takes place back when vinyl was only
beginning to “mature” and we were using an upsert in production for the first
time. We had what seemed like an ideal environment for it: we had tons of keys,
the current time was being used as values; update operations were inserting keys
or modifying the current time; and we had few reads. Load tests yielded great
results.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, after a couple of days, the Tarantool process started
eating up 100% of our CPU, and the system performance dropped close to zero.</p>
<p>We
started digging into the issue and found out that the distribution of requests
across keys was significantly different from what we had seen in the test
environment. It was…well, quite nonuniform. Most keys were updated once or
twice a day, so the database was idle for the most part, but there were much
hotter keys with tens of thousands of updates per day. Tarantool handled those
just fine. But in the case of lookups by key with tens of thousands of upserts,
things quickly went downhill. To return the most recent value, Tarantool had to
read and “replay” the whole history consisting of all of the upserts. When
designing upserts, we had hoped this would happen automatically during a
compaction, but the process never even got to that stage: the L0 size was more
than enough, so there were no dumps.</p>
<p>We solved the problem by adding a
background process that performed readaheads on any keys that had more than a
few dozen upserts piled up, so all those upserts were squashed and substituted
with the read value.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="secondary-keys">
<span id="vinyl-advanced-sec-keys"></span><h4>Secondary keys<a class="headerlink" href="#secondary-keys" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Update is not the only operation where
optimizing hidden reads is critical. Even the replace operation, given secondary
keys, has to read the older value: it needs to be independently deleted from the
secondary indexes, and inserting a new element might not do this, leaving some
garbage behind.</p>
<img alt="../../../../../_images/secondary.png" src="../../../../../_images/secondary.png" />
<p><a href="#id15"><span class="problematic" id="id16">|br|</span></a></p>
<p>If secondary indexes are not unique, then collecting “garbage” from them can be
put off until a compaction, which is what we do in Tarantool. The
append-only nature of LSM trees allowed us to implement full-blown serializable
transactions in vinyl. Read-only requests use older versions of data without
blocking any writes. The transaction manager itself is fairly simple for now: in
classical terms, it implements the MVTO (multiversion timestamp ordering) class,
whereby the winning transaction is the one that finished earlier. There are no
locks and associated deadlocks. Strange as it may seem, this is a drawback
rather than an advantage: with parallel execution, you can increase the number
of successful transactions by simply holding some of them on lock when
necessary. We’re planning to improve the transaction manager soon. In the
current release, we focused on making the algorithm behave 100% correctly and
predictably. For example, our transaction manager is one of the few on the NoSQL
market that supports so-called “gap locks”.</p>
